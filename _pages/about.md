I develop machine learning methods that combine the strength of probabilisitic modeling and language modeling. Recently, I started post-training LLMs with reinforcement learning, and witnessed the magic of RL and model scale.

Currently, I am most interested in 
* developing reinforcement learning methods for LLMs that can make use of raw internet corpora
* developing methods to improve learning of rare concepts in LLMs
* applying LLMs to the scientific discovery process

I am a CS PhD student at the Johns Hopkins University, my advisor is <a href='https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason'>Jason Eisner</a>.
